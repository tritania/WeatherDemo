# WeatherDemo
This repository contains the source code to [this](https://github.com/kyleboyle/mobile-app-weather) programming assessment.

This project was created by using ```npx react-native init``` mainly to provide quick and correct boilerplate code so development could quickly begin on the specified features. 

## Building 
The easiest way to build this project is simply to open the android directory and build in android studio, where it is a react native cli project ```npx react-native run-android``` will also work if adb and an emulator have been previously setup.

## Library & Tool Choice
[Victory](https://formidable.com/open-source/victory/docs/native/) was chosen to generate the graphs in this project due to its popularity and its concise documentation, and its drop in support in react-native. It does also pull in react-native-svg as a dependency.

Other then Victory and the react native cli the only other tools used were Android Studio for building and debugging.
